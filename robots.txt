Serve robots.txt inline in Nginx
To quickly serve a robots.txt from Nginx without actually having access to 
the physical file you can define the content of the robots.txt file in the Nginx .conf file.

Allow access to all User-agents:

  location /robots.txt {return 200 "User-agent: *\nDisallow:\n";}

Disallow access to every User-agent:

  location /robots.txt {return 200 "User-agent: *\nDisallow: /\n";}
